## ⚙️ Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Validation
```bash
# Run this before deploying:
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d jeton -f migrations/028_prospect_activity_log.sql

# Then verify:
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d jeton -c "\d prospect_activities"
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d jeton -c "\d prospects" | grep -E "interest_level|assigned_to|last_contact"
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d jeton -c "\df convert_prospect_to_deal"
```

### 2. Build Check
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete with no errors
```

### 3. Manual Testing
```bash
npm start
# Open browser to localhost:3000
# Navigate to /app/prospecting
# Test all workflows above
```

### 4. Performance Check
```bash
# Check database queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d jeton -c "
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM prospects 
WHERE sales_stage = 'Interested' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;
"
# Should use indexes, not sequential scan
```
