## Data Model: Prospect Lifecycle

```
prospect (created)
  ├─ prospect_name, email, phone, business_name
  ├─ sales_stage: 'Prospect' → 'Contacted' → 'Interested' → 'Negotiating' → 'Converted'
  ├─ follow_up_date: When to follow up next
  └─ Created prospect_activities for each interaction

prospect_activities (logged for each interaction)
  ├─ activity_type: call|email|meeting|note|outcome
  ├─ description: What happened
  ├─ outcome: interested|not_interested|no_answer|rescheduled|converted
  └─ next_followup_date: When to contact next

[CONVERSION POINT]

client (created during conversion)
  ├─ name, email, phone, business_name, address
  ├─ status: active|inactive|churned
  └─ prospect_id: FK to prospect (relationship established)

contracts (created after client conversion)
  ├─ client_id: FK to client
  ├─ system_id: FK to intellectual_property (what was sold)
  ├─ contract_value, start_date, end_date
  └─ status: draft|active|completed|cancelled

payments (when money arrives)
  ├─ contract_id: FK to contract
  ├─ amount_received, date_received
  ├─ allocation_status: pending|allocated|finalized
  └─ Payment stays 'pending' until 100% allocated

allocations (distributes payment)
  ├─ payment_id: FK to payment
  ├─ allocated_amount, allocation_type (operating|vault|expenses|investment)
  └─ Once SUM(allocations) == payment.amount, mark payment as 'allocated'
```

## Activity Types Explained

| Type | When | Example | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `call` | Phone conversation | "Called John, discussed pricing" | interested / not_interested / no_answer / rescheduled |
| `email` | Email sent/received | "Sent proposal" | - |
| `meeting` | In-person or video | "Met with client team" | interested / moved forward |
| `note` | Internal note | "Waiting for their budget approval" | - |
| `outcome` | Decision maker | "They agreed to contract" | **ALWAYS requires next_followup_date** |

## Testing the System

### 1. Create a prospect
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/prospects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prospect_name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@company.com",
    "phone": "+256...",
    "business_name": "Test Co",
    "sales_stage": "Contacted"
  }'
```

### 2. Log an activity
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/prospects/[id]/activities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "activity_type": "call",
    "description": "Initial discovery call",
    "outcome": "interested",
    "next_followup_date": "2026-01-15"
  }'
```

### 3. Check follow-ups
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/prospects/followups?filter=today
```

### 4. Convert to client
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/prospects/[id]/convert-to-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Company Ltd",
    "email": "accounts@testcompany.com",
    "phone": "+256..."
  }'
```

### 5. View metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/financial-dashboard?range=month
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see prospects in /app/prospects/followups**
A: Prospects must have `follow_up_date <= today` and `client_id IS NULL`

**Q: I can't convert a prospect**
A: Prospect must be in 'Contacted', 'Interested', or 'Negotiating' stage

**Q: Payment shows as pending**
A: Allocations don't sum to 100%. Check `/api/allocations` for payment_id

**Q: Finance Dashboard shows zeros**
A: No contracts created yet. Create contract → log payment → allocate money

**Q: Can't see activity on prospect**
A: Activity table is new. Are you using new API? Old activities in different table.
