- ❌ No dilution awareness

- ❌ No audit trail for compliance
- ❌ Not URSB-compliant

### After
- ✅ **Three-tier structure**: Authorized (max) → Issued (actual) → Allocated (owned)

- ✅ **Share issuance**: Create new shares with automatic dilution calculation
- ✅ **Live cap table**: Real-time ownership % for every shareholder
- ✅ **Complete audit trail**: Every transaction recorded with approval chain
- ✅ **URSB-compliant**: Safe, auditable, investor-ready

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### Authorized vs Issued vs Allocated

```
Your Company's Share Structure:

Authorized Shares: 10,000,000
├─ Issued Shares: 1,000,000 (10% of authorized)
│  ├─ Allocated: 950,000 (held by shareholders)
│  └─ Unallocated: 50,000 (pool for distribution)
└─ Unissued: 9,000,000 (available for future rounds)
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Authorized**: Board vote to increase (rare, strategic)
- **Issued**: Company decision (affects dilution)
- **Allocated**: Investor/employee decision (gradual)

### Share Transfer (No Dilution)

```javascript
Founder has 500k, Investor has 300k (Total: 800k)

// Transfer 250k from founder to investor
Transfer executed

Founder now 250k, Investor now 550k (Total: 800k)
// No new shares created! Pure ownership change
```

**Use cases:**
- Early investor buys founder equity
- Secondary market sales
- Founder transfers to employee
- Gift or inheritance

### Share Issuance (With Dilution)

```javascript
Before: Founder 50%, Investor 50% (1M total)

// Issue 500k new shares
Issuance executed

After: Founder 33.33%, Investor 33.33%, New 33.33% (1.5M total)
// ALL shareholders diluted by 33.33%
// This is intentional and necessary
```

**Use cases:**
- Venture funding rounds (Series A, B, C)
- Employee stock option pool
- Advisor equity grants
- Convertible note conversion

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Founding (Day 1)
```
Configure:
- Authorized: 10,000,000
- Issued: 1,000,000

Add Founder (Alice):
- Shares: 1,000,000
- Result: Alice owns 100%
```

### Seed Round (Month 6)
```
Transfer from founder to investor (Bob):
- Transfer: 300k shares @ $2.00
- Result: Alice 70%, Bob 30%, Total issued: 1M (no dilution!)
```

### Series A (Month 18)
```
New issuance for Series A investors:
- Issue: 500k shares @ $15.00
- Result: 
  • Alice: 700k shares (46.67%)  ← Diluted from 70%
  • Bob: 300k shares (20%)       ← Diluted from 30%
  • Series A: 500k shares (33.33%) ← New
  • Total issued: 1.5M
  • Founder "pain" = 23.33% dilution (this is normal)
```

### Series B (Month 30)
```
Another round of issuance:
- Issue: 750k shares @ $40.00
- Result:
  • Alice: 700k shares (26.09%)  ← Diluted again!
  • Bob: 300k shares (11.19%)    ← Diluted again!
  • Series A: 500k shares (18.66%) ← Diluted!
  • Series B: 750k shares (28%)  ← New
  • Total issued: 2.68M
  • By Series B, founder owns <30% (this is reality)
```

**This is how real companies work. Jeton now has this built in.**
